		"desc": "Software Engineering is going to be extremely critical in the coming future with Modernization trends across all industries. Every industry is looking at various ways to automate their processes, Go to Market and Selling strategy which requires less, and less human effort involved and more reach to their customers.  Hence Software Engineering becomes a centre play in everything with an infusion of hybrid cloud, AI and Machine Learning. This creates a huge demand for skills as well in the market for more trained Software Engineers.\n\n" + 
				"Looking at trends in last 5 years one can predict that generations are changing very fast and so are the demands of the generations and thus the kind of Software that we are building as well. There is an App available in App centres for almost everything that we can think of. Right from the morning Health tips, ordering food, shopping, online classes for education or any sort of learning, travel, communication, hospitals and consultations. A lot of these are highly sophisticated with AI and Machine learning making them richer in terms of features and functions. Take an example of Uber which can detect the best route for a customer based on time of the day, route availability at real time. The models can predict with a high level of accuracy the amount of time a customer can take to reach a destination given parameters involved like time of the day, traffic etc.\n\n" +
				"Each of this Application have a complete SAAS based deployment on Cloud available 24x7 highly optimized for high number of users and performing at scale. Another strong area of growth for Software Engineering is around Cloud Operations and Process Operations. There is lot of potential of AI infusion in all the operations and process areas which fall under the bucket of AI Ops."

				"abstract": "Typical software engineering involves different steps such as collecting software requirements, designing the software, building the software, testing the software and maintaining the software. These steps are very well understood in the context of typical software — however, when it comes to building AI models, we need to rethink how these steps can be applied. Building AI models especially for enterprise has its own set of challenges. Enter- prises need to worry about things such as: Are the AI models biased, are the explainable, how to measure their quality, how do we know whether they are drifted, are the models being used for use cases that they have been approved for, are the AI models adhering to all the regulations, etc. These things have an impact on all steps of the software engineering lifecycle. In this talk we will cover how software engineering is be adapted to cater to the unique needs of building and deploying AI models for enterprises.",

				"abstract": "In this talk, we explore the interplay between soft- ware engineering and machine learning under the following broad scenarios:\n\n" +
				"ML4FM\n" +
				"Formal methods is the area of computer science where we use mathematical approaches to assure the quality of software. This primarily includes methods of static and automated property prov- ing. Often testing is also included in the ambit of formal methods. It is well known that most if not all interesting properties of pro- grams are hard or even impossible to prove automatically using algorithms. Hence, formal methods people have been using heuris- tic approaches to get around the hard issues of intractability and undecidability for a very long time. Machine learning has gained prominence in all domains of information technology. It has also found place in the kitty of formal methodists in pushing through the problems for which it is impossible/hard to design pure algo- rithmic solutions. We explore the application of ML as a toolkit for FM both in research done in our institute and elsewhere.\n\n" +
				"FM4ML\n" +
				"ML now forms the core engine in an increasingly larger number of business critical software systems. This takes the problem of QA of such software to an altogether different level. In recent years, For- mal methods has taken up the challenge of automatically proving properties of ML/AI driven systems and has shown some promising results too. We touch upon some recent work in this area which is full of exciting research possibilities",
