		"desc": "Software Engineering is going to be extremely critical in the coming future with Modernization trends across all industries. Every industry is looking at various ways to automate their processes, Go to Market and Selling strategy which requires less, and less human effort involved and more reach to their customers.  Hence Software Engineering becomes a centre play in everything with an infusion of hybrid cloud, AI and Machine Learning. This creates a huge demand for skills as well in the market for more trained Software Engineers.\n\n" + 
				"Looking at trends in last 5 years one can predict that generations are changing very fast and so are the demands of the generations and thus the kind of Software that we are building as well. There is an App available in App centres for almost everything that we can think of. Right from the morning Health tips, ordering food, shopping, online classes for education or any sort of learning, travel, communication, hospitals and consultations. A lot of these are highly sophisticated with AI and Machine learning making them richer in terms of features and functions. Take an example of Uber which can detect the best route for a customer based on time of the day, route availability at real time. The models can predict with a high level of accuracy the amount of time a customer can take to reach a destination given parameters involved like time of the day, traffic etc.\n\n" +
				"Each of this Application have a complete SAAS based deployment on Cloud available 24*7 highly optimized for high number of users and performing at scale. Another strong area of growth for Software Engineering is around Cloud Operations and Process Operations. There is lot of potential of AI infusion in all the operations and process areas which fall under the bucket of AI Ops."
